# Speaker Rider

Last Updated: 07 January 2022

## Intro

Hi there! First, I'm delighted that you're interested in having me speak at your event. I truly love what I do, and I'm always excited for another opportunity to share my knowledge and viewpoints with others. That said, I do have some requirements and standards for accepting an offered speaking slot, submitting to an open CFP, or engaging in any kind of promotion for an event (yes, including retweets).

### Code of Conduct

Your event must have an explicitly-defined, enforced Code of Conduct linked publicly on your event's website, preferably as a top-level menu item. It should include a clear, readable description of what behavior is and is not acceptable, as well as at least one way for someone to report a violation. A paragraph of legalese buried in the Terms of Use is not sufficient to meet this requirement. If you're looking for inspiration, the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) is a great place to start.

### Speaker Diversity

Across your entire event, there must be adequate representation of races, gender identities, and expressions. The exact requirements fluctuate a bit based on the size of the event, but generally, at least 30% of your total speaker lineup should be people who are not cisgender white men. I would strongly prefer not to see singular representation (i.e., only one Black speaker). Making room for new speakers is also important to me.

For panels, Birds of a Feather, or any other speaking arrangement consisting of three or more people on stage at a time, there must be at least one speaker who is not a cisgender white male. All male or all white speaking groups are not acceptable.

I strongly prefer events that clearly communicate each speaker's preferred pronouns, both on the conference website and on badges. 

### Accessibility

All areas of the event (including any auxiliary events like official afterparties or co-located events) must be accessible to those who require mobility aids, including stages. 

Captioning should be provided, ideally live by a trained professional. If there is absolutely no other option, auto-generated captioning is not the greatest but will suffice. 

### Costs for Speakers

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with the speaker. My employer will cover airfare and hotel for an event, plus a day on either side of the event dates, if the conference theme or attendee demographic is one that aligns with their goals. If your event does not fit (most do, though!), you must cover a hotel near the conference venue, airfare (preferably on Delta or one of their partner airlines, as I do have status with them), and transportation between the airport and the hotel. Regardless of whether or not my employer covers the cost of my appearance at your event, you must provide me with a full pass for the event.

If your event is a significant time zone change from me (US Pacific time), I do ask that my flight in be booked to arrive a day or two before my speaking slot. 

This policy applies to *all* speakers at an event.

### Speaking Fees and Honorariums

Since speaking at events like yours is a large part of my job, I do not generally require a speaking fee or an honorarium. This is especially true for non-profits, community events, or events where the cost of attending is heavily reduced.

For large-scale, corporate event where the organizing company stands to make a profit, or private internal corporate events: in both of these cases, my fee is negotiable based on the size of the event and whether or not I am a keynote speaker. If I am being paid, all other speakers should be paid as well.

### Intellectual Property

You may record or stream my event, but I retain ownership over the content of the talk and the right to give the talk at other events at my discretion. If you record or stream a presentation, ensure that it is captioned. Recordings cannot be paywalled, and I reserve the right to ask that a recording be taken down at any point in the future for any reason of my choosing.

### COVID Policies

Your event must require both masks and proof of vaccination for me to appear in person. Masking should be actively enforced by conference staff. I understand that some local jurisdictions within the US have made it illegal to require masks or proof of vaccination; if your event is in such a jurisdiction, I will be happy to present my talk remotely.

Ideally, on-site testing should be provided, but it is not required. Personally, I will take a rapid test before flying to your event, and before entering the conference. 

### Cancellations

Cancelling a speaking engagement is something I try very, very hard to avoid. It has only happened once, and it was unavoidable. That said, the ongoing global pandemic means that a cancellation is more likely than ever before. In the case of a surge, either globally or locally, as a result of a new variant or not, I reserve the right to pull out of your event for my own safety and the safety of others. In that case, I will *always* offer a remote presentation. 

### Contacting Me

Want to have me speak? Cool! Reach out to me via [email](mailto:kat.cosgrove@gmail.com) with the name, dates, and website for your event, as well as any confirmed speakers and an idea of what you want me to talk about. If your event fits into the corporate events category, please also include your speaker budget.
