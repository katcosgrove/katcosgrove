### Hey y'all! ðŸ‘‹	

You are mostly going to find sample code, workshops, abanadoned side-projects, and old code here. The good shit is all in private repos or proprietary, sorry!

Just kidding, none of my code is good. My talks are, though! If you're interested in having me speak at your event, please read my [speaker rider](./speaking.md) before reaching out.

If you need something else, GitHub is not the best way to get a hold of me. You can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kat.lol) or you can [send me an email](mailto:kat.cosgrove@gmail.com).
